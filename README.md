Do you want to play Grepolis as a desktop app and not in a browser? Now you can! [Check out the releases!](https://github.com/MBALOTA/grepolis-desktop/releases)

Download the installer, or the portable version and enjoy playing Grepolis in the background.

 **Features planned:**
 - Notifications
 - Duration Calculator/ Overview (e.g. An overview to see how long it takes for every building or units to build)

Current builds are available for Windows only, BUT you can build your own version! Open "how_to_build.txt" for more informations.

If you encounter bugs, or if you have ideas write it in the issues page, thx.
